   > About
   
         TensorFlow is quickly becoming the technology of choice for deep learning, because of how easy TF makes it to build 
         powerful and sophisticated neural networks. The Google Cloud Platform is a great place to run TF models at scale, and 
         perform distributed training and prediction. This is a comprehensive, from-the-basics course on TensorFlow and building 
         neural networks. It assumes no prior knowledge of Tensorflow, all you need to know is basic Python programming.
